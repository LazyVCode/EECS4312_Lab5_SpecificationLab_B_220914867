Prompt 1: "Copy paste your question"
You are asked to implement a Python function that determines whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacity. The function takes as input a list of requests and available resources and returns whether a valid allocation exists. The goal is to determine feasibility of allocation based on the provided information. You may assume inputs are provided in a reasonable and consistent format. src/solution.py – starter file where you implement is_allocation_feasible. Do not rename this file

    Determines whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacity.

    Args:
        requests: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a request
                  (e.g., {"cpu": 2, "memory": 4}).
        resources: A dictionary representing available resources
                   (e.g., {"cpu": 10, "memory": 32}).

    Returns:
        True if all requests can be satisfied within the available resources, False otherwise.
